# ICD-10 and ICD-11 Coding Standards Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research ICD-10 and ICD-11 coding standards, API endpoints, data structures, and implementation requirements for web application integration.

## Research Objectives
1. **Official WHO APIs and Data Sources**
   - [x] WHO official API documentation
   - [x] ICD-10 API endpoints and data formats
   - [x] ICD-11 API endpoints and data formats
   - [x] WHO databases and datasets
   - [x] Authentication and access requirements

2. **ICD-10 vs ICD-11 Differences and Compatibility**
   - [x] Structural differences between ICD-10 and ICD-11
   - [x] Code format and validation changes
   - [x] New features in ICD-11
   - [x] Backward compatibility considerations
   - [x] Implementation timeline and adoption

3. **Cross-mapping Between Versions**
   - [x] Official mapping tables and resources
   - [x] API endpoints for cross-mapping
   - [x] Mapping quality and limitations
   - [x] Implementation approaches for cross-mapping

4. **JavaScript/Node.js Libraries**
   - [x] Official JavaScript SDKs and libraries
   - [x] Community-developed libraries
   - [x] NPM packages for ICD coding
   - [x] Library comparison and features
   - [x] Code examples and usage patterns

5. **Search and Categorization Capabilities**
   - [x] Search functionality in WHO APIs
   - [x] Categorization and taxonomy features
   - [x] Filter and sort capabilities
   - [x] Advanced search options
   - [x] Implementation examples

6. **Integration Patterns for Web Applications**
   - [x] Common integration patterns
   - [x] Best practices for web application integration
   - [x] Performance considerations
   - [x] Caching strategies
   - [x] Error handling and fallbacks

## Research Strategy
1. **Primary Sources**: WHO official documentation and APIs
2. **Secondary Sources**: Academic papers, technical documentation
3. **Practical Sources**: Developer documentation, code repositories
4. **Verification**: Cross-reference information from multiple sources

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive research report saved to `data/icd_research.md`
- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Implementation recommendations
- Code samples and integration patterns
- Resource links and references
