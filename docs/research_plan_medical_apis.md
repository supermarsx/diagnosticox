# Medical Research APIs and Clinical Databases Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research medical research APIs, clinical databases, and evidence-based medicine resources with focus on 7 specific areas:
1. PubMed and medical literature APIs
2. Clinical guidelines databases
3. Drug interaction and medication databases
4. Medical evidence grading systems
5. Real-time medical information sources
6. API authentication and rate limiting
7. JavaScript integration patterns

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Web Search and Information Gathering
- [x] 1.1 Search for comprehensive lists of medical APIs
- [x] 1.2 Research PubMed API documentation and alternatives
- [x] 1.3 Investigate clinical guidelines databases (clinicaltrials.gov, etc.)
- [x] 1.4 Research drug interaction APIs (RxNorm, DrugBank, etc.)
- [x] 1.5 Search for medical evidence grading systems and databases

### Phase 2: Deep Source Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Extract detailed content from official API documentation sites
- [x] 2.2 Analyze authentication methods and rate limiting for major APIs
- [x] 2.3 Review JavaScript integration examples and SDKs
- [x] 2.4 Investigate real-time medical information sources
- [x] 2.5 Research evidence-based medicine databases and systems

### Phase 3: Technical Documentation Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Extract specific API endpoints and parameters
- [x] 3.2 Document authentication flows and OAuth implementations
- [x] 3.3 Analyze rate limiting policies and best practices
- [x] 3.4 Compile JavaScript integration patterns and code examples
- [x] 3.5 Document clinical data structures and standards

### Phase 4: Report Compilation
- [x] 4.1 Organize findings by the 7 focus areas
- [x] 4.2 Create comprehensive API documentation section
- [x] 4.3 Provide practical integration guidance
- [x] 4.4 Include code examples and best practices
- [x] 4.5 Final review and completion check

## Target Deliverable
- Comprehensive report saved to `data/medical_apis_research.md`
- Include specific API documentation, authentication methods, rate limiting details, and JavaScript integration patterns
- Provide practical implementation guidance for each API category
